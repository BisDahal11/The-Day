  <h2>Emily Dickinson</h2>
  <div>
    Emily Dickinson (1830–1886) was an American poet known for her unique, thought-provoking poems about nature, death, love, and the inner self. She lived a quiet, reclusive life in Amherst, Massachusetts, and wrote nearly 1,800 poems—many of which were published only after her death. Her writing style is famous for its short lines, dashes, and deep meanings hidden in simple words. Today, she's considered one of the greatest poets in American literature. <br>
    In this poem, Emily Dickinson is showing how magical and mysterious the day can be. She describes the sunrise as a beautiful and lively moment, full of color, light, and life. Then, she describes the sunset as something quiet, gentle, and hard to understand—almost like a peaceful goodbye. Through this, she reminds us to notice and appreciate the beauty of nature and how each day begins and ends like a quiet story.

  <h2>The Day</h2>
  <div> 
    I'll tell you how the sun rose,<br>
    A ribbon at a time.<br>
    The steeples swam in amethyst,<br>
    The news like squirrels ran. <br><br>

    The hills untied their bonnets, <br>
    The bobolinks begun. <br>
    Then I said softly to myself, <br>
    "That must have been the sun!" <br><br>

    But how he set, I know not. <br>
    There seemed a purple stile <br>
    Which little yellow boys and girls <br>
    Were climbing all the while <br>
    Till when they reached the other side, <br>
    A dominie in gray <br>
    Put gently up the evening bars, <br>
    And led the flock away.

  <h2>Explanation of the Poem</h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Stanza 1:</h3>
    <strong>I'll tell you how the Sun rose –<br>
    A Ribbon at a time –<br></strong>
    The speaker describes sunrise as a gradual and beautiful event, like a ribbon of light unspooling across the sky. <br>

    <strong>The Steeples swam in Amethyst –<br>
    The news, like Squirrels, ran –<br></strong>
    Church steeples appear to be swimming in amethyst-colored light (a purplish hue), suggesting the early colors of dawn.  
    “The news” likely refers to the arrival of the day and sunlight, spreading quickly and energetically like squirrels. <br>

    <strong>Then I said softly to myself –<br>
    "That must have been the Sun!"<br></strong>
    The speaker reflects quietly and concludes that all this beauty and activity must have come from the sunrise. <br><br>

    <h3>Stanza 2:</h3>
    <strong>But how he set – I know not –<br>
    There seemed a purple stile<br></strong>
    The speaker admits they don’t know how the sun set—it was mysterious.
    A “stile” is a step or frame used to climb over a fence. Here, a purple stile might represent the twilight sky, the boundary between day and night.<br>

    <strong>That little Yellow boys and girls<br>
    Were climbing all the while –<br></strong>
    The children, likely symbolic of innocence or day’s playful light, are imagined as climbing over the stile—possibly moving into night or disappearing with the sunset. <br>

    <strong>Till when they reached the other side –<br>
    A Dominie in Gray –<br>
    Put gently up the evening Bars –<br>
    And led the flock away –<br></strong>
    Once the children reach the “other side” (nightfall), a Dominie (an old term for a clergyman or teacher) dressed in gray appears.
    He might represent evening, sleep, or a calm ending to the day. He gently closes the “evening bars” (like a gate) and leads the “flock” away—symbolizing rest, closure, or even death in a peaceful way.

  <h2>Summary of the Poem</h2>
  <div>
    In Emily Dickinson’s poem “I’ll tell you how the Sun rose –”, the speaker describes the beauty of sunrise and the mystery of sunset using rich, natural imagery. The sunrise is gentle and colorful, spreading like ribbons of light, with church steeples glowing purple and birds (bobolinks) beginning to sing. The hills are personified as taking off their bonnets, as if waking up. In contrast, the sunset is more mysterious—the speaker doesn’t fully understand it. It’s described as children climbing over a purple stile (a fence), symbolizing the day ending. A quiet figure dressed in gray, possibly representing night or rest, closes the “evening bars” and leads the “flock” away, suggesting the calm and peaceful close of day or even the idea of death in a gentle, natural way.
